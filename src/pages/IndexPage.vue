        <p class="text-body1">
          Dear my dearest Claudia,
        </p>

        <p class="text-body1">
          I hope this email find you before me. I would like to propose a date on December 1st,
          2024. This date would last from brunch time (12-ish) till late 9:00.
          My plan consists of us walking together through the city.
        </p>

        <p class="text-body1">
          In terms of feasting, I believe that it would be best for us to find two restaurants on our walk: one that I
          find
          interesting, and one that you find interesting. We will eat at one restaurant for lunch and one for dinner. I
          hope
          this term is amicable.
        </p>

        <p class="text-body1">
          Next, our activities would include: walking the city to take pictures and see the old architecture. There is
          also
          a
          cute outdoor art exhibit that I think would be fun to explore. But most importantly, this is a date to find
          out
          more
          about each other.
        </p>

        <p class="text-body1">
          I would also wanted to propose a pool competition between us, i think it would be an opportunity for us to
          really
          getting to really know each other
        </p>

        <p class="text-body1">
          I eagerly long for your response, ma belle.
        </p>


        <p>
          Sincerely,
          <br/>
          Your dearest bestie
          <br/>
