            Dear my dearest Claudia ‚ù§Ô∏è,
          </p>


          <p>
            I hope this email find you before me. I would like to propose a date on November 30th,
            2024. This date would last from brunch time (12-ish) till late 9:00.
            My plan consists of us have brunch, doing some outdoor doing some indoor/outdoor
            activities, then closing off with dinner at some far away restaurant.
          </p>

          <p>
            In terms of feasting, I believe that it would be best for us to find two restaurants:
            one that I
            find interesting, and one that you find interesting. We will eat at one restaurant for
            lunch and one for dinner. I hope this term is amicable.
          </p>

          I found these restaurant quite interesting and I would love to have you there.

            <dt>
              <a href="https://1908.nz/our-menus/" target="_blank">1908 Restaurant </a>
            </dt>
            <dd>
              As the name suggests, it's have been opening since 1908 and would be a nice getaway
              spot.

            <dd>
              Where I allegedly bought 2 focaccia (accidentally ofc üòâ)
            </dd>
          </dl>

          Next, depend on whether if you are an introvert or extrovert, our activities would
          include:

          <ul>
            <li>1v1 Badminton</li>
            <li>Baking</li>
            <li>Bowling</li>
            <li>Escape room</li>
            <li>Mini golf</li>
            <li>Pool</li>

          </ul>
          <p>
            After dinner, we will might get some dessert, and/or star gazing somewhere around
            Hoopers Inlet, depend on the weather. However, this is a date to find out more about
            each other.
          </p>

          <p>
            I eagerly long for your response, ma belle
          </p>

          <p>
            Sincerely,
            <br/>
            Your dearest bestie ‚ù§Ô∏è
            <br/>
